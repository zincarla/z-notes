				<p><strong>Hello!</strong> It appears that you have not set up your configuration file, it could not be read, the TLS certificate could not be loaded, or a database connection could not be made, or the authentication configuration is incorrect. A default config file has been generated for you if it did not exist already, but it still requires configuration. You may find the configuration file at &lt;installDir&gt;/configuration/config.json</p>
				<p>If this is a transient database connectivity issue, just wait a couple minutes and the server will automatically start once the database is up. Otherwise, review the log output for more information on why the server failed to start. Once the config file has been updated, or the issue resolved, restart this service</p>
